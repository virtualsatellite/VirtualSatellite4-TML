## Purpose

This development environment for the Tasking Modeling Language provides advanced editing capabilities for TML models. It allows specifying components, data flow between components and execution events that trigger components. Based on this description, it generates source code implementing the API of [Tasking](https://github.com/DLR-SC/tasking-framework). Editors and generated code provide extension mechanisms to extend your project to your specific needs.

## Requirements 

Virtual Satellite is based on Java / Eclipse and provides an installable feature with plug-ins for your personal eclipse IDE. The following infrastructure is required:
 - Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 - 64 bit
 - Windows 7 or Linux Computer - 64 bit

## Quickstart for users

If you just want to use Virtual Satellite feel free to grap it from the [Releases](https://github.com/virtualsatellite/VirtualSatellite4-TML/releases).

If you want to install TML into an existing eclipse you can use its *updatesite*.
Remember that you have to install Virtual Satellite Core as prerequisite ( as [package](https://github.com/virtualsatellite/VirtualSatellite4-Core/releases) or from its [updatesite](https://sourceforge.net/projects/virtualsatellite/files/VirtualSatellite4-Core/release/4.13.0/08b129cb4888ebf263db82a60f3f06a7bab970b9/) )

## User Manual
	
A user manual is located in the repository under *de.dlr.sc.virsat.tml.docs.feature/docs/user_manual.pdf* and can be found on the [Releases](https://github.com/virtualsatellite/VirtualSatellite4-TML/releases) site.


## Quickstart for developers

1. Open your Eclipse and switch to the Git Perspective.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Import all projects and working-sets via the ProjectSet file in _de.dlr.sc.virsat/projectSet_
6. Execute the Virtual Satellite build from _de.dlr.sc.virsat/launchers_
7. Inspect the build artifacts for the p2 repository in _de.dlr.sc.virsat.p2updatesite/target_


## Github Actions and Releases

Github Actions is set-up to start a build job for every branch and every new commit to the repository. It executes all relevant tests such as jUnit, Checkstyle, SpotBugs, etc. Making a successful pull-request into development requires all tests to pass.

Starting a Github Actions job on development or integration deploys all relevant artifacts.

## Downloads and Deployment

Deployments are done using GitHub Releases as well as sourceforge: [![Download virtualsatellite](https://sourceforge.net/sflogo.php?type=13&group_id=3065053)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/virtualsatellite/files/VirtualSatellite4-TML/)
